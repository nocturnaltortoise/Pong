Pong
====

This is a really simple Java clone of Pong, which I made as a project to apply stuff I'd learnt about Java Graphics programming. This is one of many attempts , as I was mostly just stumbling around not knowing what I was doing (some improvements have been made since I originally created this clone, but not many). Feedback is great if you have any. Bear in mind that the code is if anything overly commented, mostly for my own purposes.
